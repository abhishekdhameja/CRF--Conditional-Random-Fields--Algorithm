{"job_desc": " About Uber\n We\u2019re changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we\u2019re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it\u2019s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it. \n \nFor the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer. \n \nAnd that\u2019s just what we\u2019re doing today. We\u2019re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we\u2019re in for the long haul.

Frameworks like React/Flux/Redux or Angular.js are a plus. \nKnowledge of a backend stack, including technologies like Golang, Java, Node.js, and how they interface with Redis, Kafka, or similar. \nBias toward action. You believe that speed and quality aren't mutually exclusive. You've shown good judgment about shipping as fast as possible while ensuring your products and platforms are built in a sustainable, responsible way-and you're comfortable making mistakes, provided you learn from them. \nUnquenchable thirst for growth. You're not just looking for the next interesting challenge, but looking to push yourself to keep pace in our high growth environment. \nWillingness to mentor. In a full-stack role, you are a polyglot, but maybe speak one language more fluently than another. Help those that are the reverse! \n \nAbout the Team \n Trucks move everything you buy, why shouldn\u2019t booking a truck be as seamless as booking an Uber? \n \nUber Freight connects shippers with carriers / truck drivers, much like the way the Uber connects riders and drivers. The Uber Freight team believes that empowering truck drivers will bring more open, efficient, and increasingly safer transportation to our roads.
